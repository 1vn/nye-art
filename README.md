# "visual accessory"

## What is this for?
This is the code for my art installation visuals for "countdown", a social function I hosted for new years eve celebrations.

## What does it do?
This program creates a web page which plays a random video from Youtube at a random start time. Currently you have to manually find videos and input an upper bound for the start time yourself. It also displays a countdown of hours:minutes:seconds to a date which you can also has to be hard coded (I've committed it to work for next year.)

##TODO
- move hard coded stuff to seperate files
- make menu/interface for set up
